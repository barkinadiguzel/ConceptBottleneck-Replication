# ConceptBottleneck-Replication
ConceptBottleneck-Replication is a minimal reference implementation of Concept Bottleneck Models that translates the core theoretical framework into a clean and practical architecture. It focuses on the x → c → y bottleneck structure, concept intervention, and joint loss formulation without including training or dataset pipelines.
